# Permissions and ownership

Dancelor has two distinct parts with different permission models: the public catalogue and the private workspace.

## The public catalogue

The public catalogue contains metadata about the Scottish country dance world:

- **Persons** (composers, arrangers, etc.)
- **Sources** (books, recordings, etc.)
- **Dances**
- **Tunes**

This part is managed by database maintainers to ensure quality and consistency. If you spot an error or want to add something to the public catalogue, please use the bug report button.

## The private workspace

The private workspace uses a standard ownership model where each entry has one or more owners. Owners can:

- Control who can view their entries
- Edit their entries
- Delete their entries
- Share ownership with other users

The private workspace currently includes:

- **Sets**
- **Books**

### Why have a private workspace?

The private workspace serves two purposes:

1. **Reducing clutter**: Not everything everyone creates needs to be visible to all users. The private workspace lets you organise your own material without cluttering the public space.

2. **Copyright protection**: Many musicians create their own arrangements and compilations. The private workspace lets you control who can access your work and protect your copyright.

That said, if you want to share your sets or books publicly, you're welcome to do so—owners can choose to make their entries public.

## Versions: a special case

Versions occupy an unusual middle ground. A **version** entry itself is public (you can see that it exists, along with its key, sources, and arrangers), but the **content** (the actual musical notation) has copyright considerations.

This means you might see a version listed but not be able to view its score. This is admittedly a bit odd, and we intend to improve this in the future. For now, if you encounter a version whose content you cannot access, it's because the owner has restricted access to the notation itself.
