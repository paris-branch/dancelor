# Tunes and versions

Dancelor makes a distinction between **tunes** and **versions**. Understanding this difference will help you navigate and use Dancelor more effectively.

## What is a tune?

A **tune** is the musical concept that people usually talk about in everyday conversation. When a dancer says "I love when you play Tam Lin" or when you see "Tam Lin" listed on a CD track, they're referring to the tune.

Think of a tune as the song itself—the idea of the music, regardless of exactly how it's played. A tune has:

- **Names**: What the tune is called (and alternative names)
- **Kind**: What type of tune it is (jig, reel, strathspey, etc.)
- **Composers**: Who wrote it (if known)
- **Associated dances**: Which dances use this tune

## What is a version?

A **version** is a specific, playable instance of a tune. It's what a band leader means when they say "let's play Tam Lin"—they're thinking of the particular arrangement their band has agreed upon, with specific notation they can read and play.

A version has:

- **Musical notation**: The actual score you can read and play
- **Sources**: Where this particular arrangement came from (books, recordings, etc.)
- **Arrangers**: Who created or transcribed this specific arrangement
- **Structure**: How the parts are organised (e.g., AABB, ABAB, AABC)

## The practical difference

The same tune can have many different versions. Traditional tunes especially will appear with different chord progressions, slightly different melodies, or various arrangements. Each of these is a separate version of the same tune.

For example, when a CD liner says a set contains "Tam Lin," they're referring to the tune. But of course, they're playing one (or sometimes two or three) specific versions of it.

## Destructured versions

Dancelor also supports **destructured versions**, which are versions entered part by part. This is useful for versions that are essentially the same but might be played with different structures—like AABB versus ABAB or ABABB. Dancelor can display these with a default structure, but you can customise the structure when creating a set.

See [Destructured versions](./destructured-versions.md) for more details on how these work.
