(** Makes a search bar and exposes whatever is useful to interact with it. The
    arguments are to be used as follows:

    - [search] is an Lwt function that returns either a list of results or a
      list of error messages to display. It should respect the given slice
      and return the total number of entries that match the query.

    - [min_characters] is an integer indicating the minimum number of characters
      to type for the search bar to fire. By default, there is no such limit.

    - [slice] is a signal giving the state of the slice.

    - [on_number_of_entries] is a function that fires whenever the [search]
      returns a number of entries.

    - [initial_input] is a string specifying the initial input of the search
      bar. This string will appear in the search bar and a first search will be
      triggered with it.

    - [placeholder] shows in the bar when no text is entered yet;

    - [id] is a string that specifies the id of the search bar;

    - [on_focus] is a function that fires when the bar gains focus;

    - [on_input] is a function that triggers whenever there is an input.

    - [on_enter] is a function that triggers when the user presses Enter.
